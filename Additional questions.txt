1. I'd firstly have to choose one of the environment services to run my CI/CD on, which could either be Bamboo, Jenkins etc.
-  Select the plugin 
- Then finally install them


2. If its for automation, there has to be configues in place as to know the kind of tests to execute on X platform.
- I would keep myself updated with broswer verions to be used
- Response speed is also key per browser
-

3. Validations for all fields
- Error handlings exceptions
- execute tests pararrel with different browsers
- Coded a better reusable framework for my tests
- Would have also stored my data seperately on the test data file.
